# Sign Language Translation System 🤟🧠

This repository accompanies the research paper **“A Deep Learning-Based Sign Language Translation System Using Vision and Language Models”**, accepted and presented at an **IEEE conference (2025)**. The paper will be published on **IEEE Xplore** in the coming months.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This project introduces a multi-stage pipeline for sign language understanding, combining:

- 🖼️ **Sign Detection & Classification**  
  A custom image dataset was created and used to train a CNN-based classifier for static hand signs.

- ✍️ **Gloss-to-English Translation**  
  Fine-tuned a pre-trained **T5 language model** to convert detected glosses (sign annotations) into natural English sentences.

- 🔄 **Vision-Language Integration**  
  The system integrates image-based predictions with language translation for real-time or batch sign interpretation.
